## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Simple knowledge of `Windows File Explorer`
### Steps
1. Locate the latest release in the releases section.
2. Download the zip file `Rapid.Fire.[version].zip`
3. Unzip the file to get the contents.
4. Delete the `.zip` file, and then open the `Rapid Fire[version]` folder.
5. Run `Personal Project.exe`.
**If you encounter any Windows Defender issues, allow it to run anyway. I'm not sure why this happens, but I promise it isn't a virus.**

## Usage
### Default controls
- WASD for movement
- Mouse position for shooting direction
- Left click to shoot
- 1 for pistol, 2 for assault rifle
- Esc for pause menu or to go back
- Spacebar to jump
- Scroll wheel to zoom in and out

## Upcoming Features
- Shop system that allows the player to spend experience points (exp) to get new guns, ammo, abilties, and more.
- More sound effects, particles, and better art for UIs.
- An actual map for the user to play around in and find secrets in. _This feature will most likely get delayed heavily, since it requires a complete redo of current logic for spawning and path-finding._
- HUD and inventory<br>
### If you want anything else added or changed, you can create new [issue(s)](https://github.com/ChristianGrinch/Rapid-Fire/issues) for each of your requests.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request. For any medium-major sized changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like changed.  _I'm not obligated to put your changes into production. I will consider them if they align with my view of the game._

## itch-io
itch.io is an app/website that allows developers to publish their games and send out updates similarly to how developers on a platform like steam send out **updates** to the game instead of entire redownloads. itch.io is really helpful for the player, especially if they have slower internet. I will keep the itch.io up to date with the same releases that this repo gets, assuming there are people that want it to be updated. I will not publish any releases to itch.io if no one wants to use the app. <br>
