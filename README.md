## Project Concept

### 1. Player Control
In this **top-down shooter** game, you control a person using keyboard and mouse inputs to:
- Shoot
- Use abilities
- Move
- Change direction

### 2. Basic Gameplay
During the game, **enemies** will appear from every side of the screen.  
The goal of the game is to **survive as many waves as possible**.

### 3. Sound & Effects
There will be sound effects for:
- Guns
- Damage
- Enemies

There will also be particle effects when a bullet hits an enemy.

### 4. Gameplay Mechanics
As the game progresses, the waves will increase in difficulty with **different enemies** spawning, making it harder to stay alive.

### 5. User Interface
- Health will decrease whenever you get hit by an enemy.
- The title "**Rapid Fire**" will appear at the start of the game.
- The game will end when you die.

### 6. Other Features
*(To be determined)*

### 7. Notes
The gameplay is similar to a mobile game where you spin in circles, shoot zombies, and collect abilities from them.
